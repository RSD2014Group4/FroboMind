obstacle_range: 2.5
# The "obstacle_range" parameter determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap.

raytrace_range: 3.0
# The "raytrace_range" parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading.

#robot_radius: ir_of_robot
inflation_radius: 0.2

# The inflation radius should be set to the maximum distance from obstacles at which a cost should be incurred. For example, setting the inflation radius at 0.55 meters means that the robot will treat all paths that stay 0.55 meters or more away from obstacles as having equal obstacle cost.
